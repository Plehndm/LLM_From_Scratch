🧠 Building a GPT-Like LLM From Scratch

A ground-up implementation of a GPT-style large language model designed to deeply understand how modern LLMs work under the hood.

📌 Project Overview

This project documents my step-by-step construction of a GPT-like large language model starting from first principles. The goal is not just to obtain a working model, but to build my intuition about every major component involved in modern transformer-based language models.

Join me in expanding your knowledge about how large language models work!

Current status: Early foundation complete
End goal: Fully functional GPT-style LLM trained end-to-end
